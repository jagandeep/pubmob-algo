Notes for next session
 - [ ] add tests for Averages
 - [ ] ShouldBuy tests are testing lower level predicate details; we want to simplify to stub them and just ensure the boolean combinations
 - [ ] should buy is incorrect, replace threshold ??
 - [ ] previous test broken AlgorithmTests, somewhat excepted (approvals--not working)

# TODOS

- [x] Make sure we are green
- [ ] State Machine
  - [x] Isolate Took Profits
  - [x] Work out how many states
- [x] handle did not take profits state
- [x] create abstraction for moving averages
- [x] Pass averages to state, not moving averages
- [x] Line 105--return state from sell / buy 
- [X] Diagram current states

# Next

- [x] Introduce State Machine with took profits and everything else
- [x] Review state diagram
- [x] Make the state inner classes named (non-anonymous) 
- [X] Testing Ready to Buy state
- [x] Create state for 50day MA flag
- [ ] Diagram new objective (add new states for new requirement)
- [ ] Test drive new Buy requirement
